Overview
This Python script demonstrates the use of multithreading to efficiently download multiple files concurrently while performing other tasks. By leveraging multiple threads, the script can significantly improve overall execution time, especially for I/O-bound operations.

How to Run:

Save the Code: Save the code as a Python file (e.g., multithreaded_download.py).
Run the Script: Execute the script from your terminal:
 
Code Explanation:
The code consists of three main parts:
1. Function Definitions:
download_file(file_id): Simulates downloading a file by sleeping for a random duration and printing a message.
perform_other_task(task_id): 
Simulates performing another task by sleeping for a random duration and printing a message.
3. Thread Creation and Execution:
Creates a list of threads for file downloads and another list for other tasks.
Starts each thread using the start() method.
Waits for all threads to finish using the join() method.
4. Output:
Prints messages indicating the start and completion of each download and task.
Prints a final message when all threads have finished.
Key Points:
Multithreading: The script utilizes multiple threads to execute tasks concurrently.
1.Asynchronous Operations: While the script simulates asynchronous operations, real-world scenarios might involve true asynchronous programming techniques for more efficient I/O-bound operations.
2.Thread Management: The threading module is used to create, start, and manage threads.
