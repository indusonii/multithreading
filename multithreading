What is Multithreading?
Imagine you have multiple tasks to do. Instead of doing them one by one, you could assign each task to a different person to work on simultaneously. 
This is essentially what multithreading does in programming. It allows a program to execute multiple tasks concurrently within a single process.

Where is Multithreading Used?

Multithreading is used in various applications to improve performance and responsiveness. Some common use cases include:
I/O-bound tasks: Downloading files, reading from or writing to files, network operations.
Parallel processing: Breaking down large tasks into smaller subtasks that can be executed in parallel.
User interface responsiveness: Keeping the user interface responsive while performing background tasks.

Key Features of Multithreading:

Concurrency: Multiple threads can run concurrently, but they share the same process resources.
Context Switching: The operating system switches between threads to give each thread a chance to execute.
Thread Safety: It's important to ensure that multiple threads can access shared resources safely, avoiding race conditions and data corruption.
GIL (Global Interpreter Lock): In Python, the GIL limits the execution of Python bytecode to one thread at a time.
This can impact the performance of CPU-bound tasks, but it's generally not a significant issue for I/O-bound tasks.

Types of Multithreading:
While Python doesn't directly support multiple threads executing simultaneously due to the GIL, there are two primary approaches to 
achieve concurrent execution:

Thread-based Concurrency:


Uses the threading module to create and manage threads.
Primarily suitable for I/O-bound tasks.
Limited by the GIL for CPU-bound tasks.
Process-based Concurrency:


Uses the multiprocessing module to create separate processes.
Can fully utilize multiple CPU cores for CPU-bound tasks.
Requires more overhead due to process creation and communication.
